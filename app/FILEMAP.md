# app/ — PickleBallers PWA (read this first)

Mobile-first React PWA for finding pickleball games, courts, clubs, and players.
**This file is the map.** Skim it before grepping/scanning the tree — it points
you straight at the right file so you don't have to read everything.

- Deep architecture, the add-a-screen checklist, and the roadmap-update rule
  live in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Repo-wide conventions live in
  [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). This file is the quick index; keep it short.

## Commands

```sh
npm run build    # tsc -b && vite build  — MUST stay clean after any change
npm run lint     # eslint .
npm run preview  # preview the production build
npm run doctor   # react-doctor diagnostics (lint/a11y/bundle/architecture)
```

## Stack

React 19 · TypeScript · Vite 8 · Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`, no config file —
tokens are CSS vars in `src/shared/styles/index.css`) · Leaflet (maps) ·
Material Symbols + a wrapper `Icon` · vite-plugin-pwa. Most state is local
`useState`; **auth/session state lives in a Zustand store**
(`shared/lib/authStore.ts`) so screens read the current user without prop-drilling.

## Entry points & navigation

- `index.html` → `src/main.tsx` → **`src/App.tsx`** (the composition root: holds
  all nav state, auth/guest state, and renders chrome + the active screen).
- No router lib. Navigation is a **screen-stack in `App.tsx`**: a `Screen`
  discriminated union + history array; `navigate(id, params?)` pushes, `goBack()`
  pops. The union and `tabScreens`/`TabId` live in `src/shared/lib/navigation.ts`.
- To add a screen: create it in the right `features/<slice>/`, then add it to the
  `Screen` union **and** the `renderScreen()` switch in `App.tsx`. (Full checklist
  in CLAUDE.md.)

                       #   default and syncTabUrl's omit-the-default rule had to flip together, or
                       #   picking Events writes nothing to the URL and a reload bounces you back.

## Key shared modules (know these before touching behavior)

- **`shared/lib/navigation.ts`** — `Screen` union, `ScreenId`, `tabScreens`, `Navigate`.
- **`shared/lib/permissions.ts`** — roles → permissions, `AppUser`, `userHasPermission`, `firstNameOf`.
- **`shared/lib/authStore.ts`** — Zustand store: `user`, `isLoggedIn`, and the
  `login`/`logout`/`restore`/`updateProfile`/`completeOnboarding` actions. Read it directly
  with `useAuthStore((s) => s.user)` instead of threading the user through props. Wraps `api.ts`
  (`updateProfile`/`completeOnboarding` → `PATCH /me`).
- **`shared/lib/api.ts`** — the API client. Auth (login/logout/`/me`) with token storage in
  `localStorage` + `toAppUser`, **and** venues/courts (`listVenues`/`getVenue` →
  `ApiVenue`/`ApiVenueDetail`). Talks to the Hono API (relative in dev via the Vite proxy;
  `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in prod). `shared/lib/venueDisplay.ts` holds the venue formatters
  (price/location/tags/amenities/`mapsUrl`). Also carries the **owner** endpoints
  (`listOwnerVenues`/`getOwnerVenue`/`updateVenue`/`createVenue`, courts/hours/closures/faqs/
  reviews CRUD, `uploadVenueMedia`, `submitVenueClaim` (claim an unclaimed listing), `fetchCities`/`geocodePlace`/`suggestPlaces` (type-ahead address list), plus the owner bookings inbox
  `getVenueBookings`/`updateBookingStatus` and `getVenueAnalytics`→`OwnerAnalytics`) + their
  `Owner*` types, **and
  the games endpoints** (`listGames`/`getGame`/`createGame`/`joinGame`/`leaveGame` → `ApiGame`);
  `features/games/gameDisplay.ts` holds the game formatters (day/time/location/title/spots).
- **`shared/lib/game-link.ts`** — `extractGameUrl(body)` detects game URLs in text
  (`/games/<id>` or full URLs) and extracts the game ID; `apiGameToCardData(game)`
  maps an `ApiGame` → `GameLinkCard` (used by the club chat send wrappers).
- **`shared/lib/demoState.tsx`** — `DemoStateProvider`/`useDemoState`; lets reviewers flip
  normal/empty/loading/error/offline. Screens branch on it via `DemoBranch`.
- **`shared/styles/index.css`** — design tokens + most component classes (`.avatar`,
  `.game-row`, `.tabbar`, `.sticky-cta`, …). Prefer tokens over hard-coded hex.

## App behavior worth knowing

- **Guest-first flow:** cold start lands on the **home tab as a guest** (not the
  landing page). Guests browse everything; **commit actions** (join a game, create
  a game/club, the "You"/profile tab) are soft-gated by `requireAuth(intent)` in
  `App.tsx`, which opens `AuthPromptSheet` → login. Screen-level gates are driven
  by `SCREEN_PERMISSIONS` + `SCREEN_AUTH_INTENT` in `App.tsx`; the Join button is
  gated via the `onRequireAuth` prop on `GameDetailsScreen`.
- **Login is live against the API:** `LoginScreen` calls `useAuthStore().login()` →
  `POST /api/v1/auth/login`, stores tokens, and the user populates the greeting, profile,
  sidebar, etc. On cold start `App.tsx` calls `authStore.restore()` to revalidate a stored
  token via `/me`. **Profile edits save to the account** (`EditProfileScreen` → `updateProfile`
  → `PATCH /me`) and **onboarding is remembered** via a `hasOnboarded` flag on the user
  (set by `completeOnboarding`); `App.tsx` only onboards when `!user.hasOnboarded`. Profile
  *stats* (win rate, streak, achievements) are still demo data — only identity fields come from the API.
- **Nearby tab is live** (the tab labelled "Nearby"; `nearby` screen id): `NearbyScreen` lists venues and `CourtDetailsScreen` loads one
  from `/api/v1/venues` (see `api.ts`/`venueDisplay.ts`). Both own their loading/error/empty
  states. The list **paginates** (20/page via "Load more" using the API cursor) and shows
  venue **images** (media-derived) with a gradient fallback. **Near me:** the "Near me"
  chip / locate button asks for the user's location (`shared/lib/geo.ts`) and shows the
  courts *near them* — locatable venues only, ranked nearest-first and capped to a radius
  (default 10 km, adjustable in the sheet; `resolveNearby`), with a nearest-few fallback —
  not the whole directory. **Open to guests** (browse aid); `player.venues.locate` only governs signed-in
  users (`!isLoggedIn || userHasPermission(...)`). **Filters narrow the list too:** the quick
  chips (Games here / Indoor / Free / Lighted) and the `NearbyFilterSheet` (court type, price,
  open play, distance cap, amenities) edit one `VenueFilters` state applied via `matchesFilters`
  (`venueFilters.ts`). Filtering or locating switches the list to the full set (so a filter
  can't hide matches on unfetched pages); otherwise it stays the server-paged directory. Real
  data is sparse (ratings/coords often null) so fields degrade gracefully. **Court detail is
  fully live:** its location card renders a real Leaflet map at the venue's coords (falls back
  to the decorative pin box when a venue has no lat/lng), and the **"Games here"** list loads
  real games hosted at the venue via `listGames({ venueId })` (matched by the game's fixed
  `venueId`) — own loading/empty/error states; nothing on this screen is demo anymore.
- **Games tab is live:** `GamesScreen` has two top tabs — **Booking** and **Games**.
  **Booking** is the court-bookings view (`listBookings`/`cancelBooking`) with a **calendar ⇄
  list** toggle (month grid dots days that have bookings; tap a day to see its cards). **Games**
  holds the **My Games / Browse** sub-tabs: **Browse** = public published games from
  `/api/v1/games`, grouped into date sections with rich cards (time rail, roster avatars,
  spots/skill); **My Games** = games you created or joined, as commitment cards with a status
  accent (HOSTING/GOING). `GameDetailsScreen` loads one via
  `getGame` and **Join** calls `joinGame` (soft-gated by `onRequireAuth`; spots/roster are
  server-derived). A game's roster **is** its lobby: when it fills the **host** sees a
  "lobby full — ready to play" banner **and** gets a real notification in their inbox (the API
  emits a `game_full` `Notification` to the creator on the join that fills the game — see the
  Notifications note below); **joiners** get a **Leave game** action governed by the
  `LOBBY_LEAVE_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS` rules in `gameDisplay.ts` (`isLobbyFull`/`isWithinGracePeriod`/
  `canLeaveLobby`) — leaveable while the lobby has openings, or when full and the game is still
  >N days out; a full lobby inside the window locks the spot in (final/non-refundable). Joining
  **within** that window first asks for confirmation in a no-refund modal. The rule is enforced
  in the UI **and** on the server — `leaveGame` returns 409 `LOBBY_LOCKED` if a non-host tries to
  leave a full lobby inside the window. `CreateGameScreen` is **venue-first**: a 3-step wizard (pick a priced court
  via `listAllVenues` + search → date + start/end time with a live `rate × hours` cost → game
  details) ending in a **payment** step that books the court (`createBooking` → `checkout`) and
  then posts a fixed-venue game (`createGame` with `venueId` + the booking's `bookingId`). With a
  `gameId` prop it instead renders the **manage** form — edit type/skill/name/spots/visibility
  (`updateGame`) and remove players (`kickPlayer`); venue + schedule are read-only. There is **no
  vote/lobby flow** — games are joinable immediately and open in `GameDetailsScreen`.
  Gated by `player.games.create` (`SCREEN_PERMISSIONS`); creating also exercises
  `player.bookings.create` (the host books the court). Browse **date grouping** is client-side
  over all upcoming published games; the **quick chips + `GameFilterSheet` now filter for real**
  (client-side via `gameFilters.ts` — when/skill/type/has-openings; both edit one `GameFilters`
  state, the header button shows an active-filter count). The search box was removed; the
  Game-Details **chat** is live (`GET|POST /games/:id/messages`), and so is Open Play's —
  see the games slice notes above.
- **Social tab = Clubs + Friends.** Both are "people I play with", so they share one
  tab (`social`, path `/social?tab=clubs|friends`). Friends used to sit three taps deep
  in Profile and nobody found it; it is now half of a top-level tab, and the **badge**
  on that tab (pending friend requests) is what actually surfaces it. Landing on a bare
  `/social`: Friends if requests are waiting, else Clubs — so existing club members see
  no change. The tab is **public** (Clubs is guest-browsable); the auth gate lives inside
  `FriendsPanel`, not in `SCREEN_PERMISSIONS`. `/clubs` and `/friends` remain as
  back-compat aliases onto the right panel, and `tabForScreen` maps the whole club
  family + `friends` → `social`.
- **Clubs are live** (the Clubs half of the **Social** tab, plus the home **Clubs**
  quick-action):
  `ClubsPanel` lists your clubs (`listClubs({ mine: true })`) + a
  Discover directory (`listClubs()`, your clubs filtered out), with server-side search.
  `ClubDetailsScreen` (mounted with `clubId`) loads the club, members, and a
  **Facebook-style feed** — members post (`createClubPost`) and like (`react/unreactClubPost`),
  tapping a post opens the single-post permalink (`ClubPostScreen`), and a post's author edits it
  on a **dedicated page** (`ClubPostEditScreen` → `editClubPost`, opened from the ⋯ menu in both the
  feed and the permalink — comments still edit inline);
  members also get a **live member group chat** separate from the feed (`ClubChatScreen` →
  `listClubMessages`/`sendClubMessage`, realtime via the `club.message` SSE event; a "Club chat" entry
  on the detail, gated by `player.clubs.chat`);
  and anyone can join/leave (`joinClub`/`leaveClub`); the host can't leave but can **edit**
  (`EditClubScreen` → `updateClub`) or **delete** the club (`deleteClub`) from the ⋯ menu,
  which also carries an **invite/share** link
  (`/clubs/<slug>`, native share or clipboard). Arriving via that link shows a welcome modal
  (`invited` prop). Feed/members refetch on tab switch. `CreateClubScreen`
  posts to `createClub` then opens the new club (`replace` so Back skips the wizard); `EditClubScreen`
  prefills + `PATCH`es, then Back remounts the detail with fresh data. Gated by
  the `player.clubs.*` permissions (create/join/post/react/chat; edit reuses `player.clubs.create` + host-ownership). Clubs client lives in `shared/lib/api.ts`. (No club-events surface —
  the old Events tab was dropped; nested post replies aren't shown in the app yet.)
- **Notifications are live** (Profile → bell): `NotificationsScreen` reads the user's real inbox
  (`listNotifications`/`markNotificationRead`/`markAllNotificationsRead` → `/api/v1/notifications`,
  in the API's `interactions` slice). Rows tap through when their `linkUrl` is a known app path
  (currently `/games/:id` → game-details). Today the only producer is the games **`game_full`**
  notification (host's lobby filled); gated by the existing `user.notifications.manage`.
- **Web Push (real OS notifications)** delivers those alerts even with the app closed.
  `shared/lib/push.ts` (`enablePush`/`refreshPushSubscription`/`unbindPushOnLogout`/`disablePush`)
  subscribes the device via the service worker and registers it (`/api/v1/push/*` in `api.ts`); the
  SW push/notificationclick handlers live in `public/push-sw.js` (pulled into the Workbox-generated
  SW via `vite.config` `workbox.importScripts`). `NotificationsScreen` shows a "Turn on push" prompt
  (gated by `user.notifications.manage`); `authStore` re-binds the device on login/restore and
  unbinds on logout. The API signs + sends with VAPID when a game fills.
- **Owner console:** users with `owner.access` see a **"My venues"** row in the Profile
  ("You") tab → `owner-venues`. `OwnerVenuesScreen` lists their venues (live, via
  `listOwnerVenues`); `OwnerVenueScreen` is a single screen with an in-screen tab strip
  (Overview/Listing/Location/Courts/Closures/FAQs/Reviews/Photos) editing live API data
  (operating hours are per-court, inside the Courts tab; Closures = venue-wide dates);
  `OwnerNewVenueScreen` creates one; `ClaimVenueScreen` (`claim-venue`, gated by
  `owner.venues.claim`) searches the directory for an **unclaimed** listing and submits an
  ownership claim with proof + ID upload (claimant tracks status + resubmits on `needs_info`).
  An admin reviews it in `features/admin/AdminClaimsScreen` (`admin-claims`) → on approve the
  venue becomes `claimed` + links to the owner. All gated by `SCREEN_PERMISSIONS` in `App.tsx`.
  Same API the web `/owner/` console uses; no API changes. (Known gaps mirror web: photos
  are upload-only, address text/city are staff-managed, no token refresh on 401.)
- **Organizer console (Phase 3):** users with `organizer.access` see an **"Organize"** row
  in Profile (both designs) → `organizer-hub`. From the hub: **Tournaments** (create draft →
  request venue → open registration → manage participants/payments → announcements →
  bracket: build/seed/generate/score → standings), **Open Play** (recurring series + per-session
  roster), **Player Lists** (reusable rosters), **Venue Requests**. All `features/organizer/`,
  gated by `organizer.*` via `SCREEN_PERMISSIONS`; reuses the web `/organizer` + bracket API
  (no API/route/permission changes). The bracket is mobile-adapted (round-by-round cards +
  a score BottomSheet, not the web's pan/zoom canvas). Out of scope: co-host assignment
  (net-new, needs API), leagues/seasons, and v2.1-redesigned variants of these screens.
- **Player design — "Pickleballers Mockup v2.1":** v2.1 is the **only** player
  design. The legacy New/Classic variants, their floating toggle
  (`DesignSwitch`/`HomeScreenSwitch`), and the `playerDesign` store (`pb-home-design`)
  were removed — every player/guest now sees the "Pickleballers Mockup v2.1"
  redesign: `features/*/v2/*ScreenV2`
  (Home/Nearby/Games/Clubs/Profile/Settings + `CreateGameV2`/`CreateClubV2`, all wired to the
  same live API + formatters as the v1 screens). In v2.1 the **"Game On"** create
  action opens `games/v2/CreateChoiceSheet` (an app-level BottomSheet, `App.tsx`):
  **Join** → Games browse; **Host a lobby** → pick one of your hostable bookings
  (`listBookings` minus already-hosted/cancelled/past) or, with none, go to
  **Nearby** (`intent:'lobby'` → "select a court" banner + a book→create-lobby
  hand-off via `court-details`/`book-court`). `CreateGameV2` then hosts a lobby on
  that **existing booking** — it loads the reservation (`getBooking`), locks
  venue/date/time, and only `createGame({ bookingId })` (no inline book/pay; that
  happened up-front in the Book flow). The v2 screens share chrome from
  `shared/components/layout/V2Chrome.tsx` (`V2Shell`/`V2TopNav`/`V2TabBar`/`V2Fab`)
  and styling from `shared/styles/v2.css` — every rule scoped under `.pb-v2.v2-<screen>`
  (auto-ported from the mockup). For players `App.tsx` suppresses the app's own
  mobile TabBar (v2 supplies its own); the desktop Sidebar stays.
  **Owners** never see v2 (gated by `!owner.access`; `App.tsx` keys this off
  `playerV2 = !isOwner`): they keep their owner dashboards on Home/Nearby/Games and
  fall through to the **retained v1 player screens** for Clubs/Profile/Settings/Create-club.
  `CreateGameScreen` (v1) is also retained for the `edit-game` route — `CreateGameV2`
  only creates, it has no edit mode.
- **Player home (`v2/HomeScreenV2`):** the home **hero is live**: your next
  commitment is the **soonest of your
  games (`listGames({ mine: true })`) and court bookings (`listBookings()`)** —
  a court booking renders the same hero (party size instead of a roster, opens
  My bookings); else it features the best open game (`listGames({ status:
  'published' })`); else the create-a-game prompt. **Open games near you**
  (`listGames({ status: 'published' })`) is a live list, and **Courts to book** is
  **location-aware**: it best-effort requests the user's location (`geo.ts`), and
  once located pulls the full directory (`listAllVenues`) to rank courts
  nearest-first with a distance on each card (heading flips to "Courts near you");
  with no location it falls back to the plain `listVenues({ pageSize: 6 })` list.
  The **check-in banner is live**: it shows the busiest venue right now from real
  check-ins (`getCheckInHotspot`) and hides when nobody's checked in. (The in-app
  check-in/out toggle was removed from the court page — `CourtDetailsScreen` is now
  pure details + "Games here"; the `player.venues.checkin` perm/API still exist.)
  Only the streak card stays demo (no player-stats backend).
- **Chrome:** TabBar (mobile) + Sidebar (desktop) render via `App.tsx`; hidden on
  `landing`/`login`/`onboarding`. The mobile v2 TabBar's tabs are **Home · Map ·
  Games · Tournament · Social · Profile** (Social carries a live badge with the
  count of friend requests awaiting your answer — `useFriendRequestStore`); the legacy/owner chrome also includes
  a Tournament tab. The old center **+** create-FAB was removed in favour of a Clubs
  tab; create a game from the home "Create match" quick-action. The desktop Sidebar still
  carries the create FAB (`onCreate`/`canCreate` props remain for it).

## Conventions (brief — full rules in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md)

- Feature slices import cross-feature code only through `shared/`. No `../../../`.
- Don't recreate flat `src/{screens,components,hooks,lib}/` — removed in the slice migration.
- Tailwind classes inline; colors via CSS-var tokens. Loading = `LoadingSkeleton`, not spinners.
- New top-level docs → `../docs/`, screenshots → `../docs/screenshots/`, scripts → `../scripts/`.
- A meaningful change (new/removed screen, flow change, big refactor) also requires a
  roadmap update in `../web/.../RoadmapPage.jsx` — see CLAUDE.md.

## Where to look first, by task

| Task | Open first |
|---|---|
| Navigation / new screen / auth-or-guest flow | `App.tsx`, `shared/lib/navigation.ts` |
| Player UI ("Pickleballers Mockup v2.1" — the only player design) | `features/*/v2/*` (the v2 player screens), `shared/components/layout/V2Chrome.tsx`, `shared/styles/v2.css` (wired in `App.tsx` via `playerV2 = !isOwner`) |
| Login / current user / session | `shared/lib/authStore.ts`, `shared/lib/api.ts`, `LoginScreen.tsx` |
| Nearby tab / courts (list + detail, distance sort, filters) | `features/venues/NearbyScreen.tsx`, `CourtDetailsScreen.tsx`, `NearbyFilterSheet.tsx`, `venueFilters.ts`, `shared/lib/venueDisplay.ts`, `shared/lib/geo.ts` (owners get `features/owner/OwnerNearbyScreen.tsx` — a "your venues" ops map) |
| Games tab (browse/mine, create, detail, join) | `features/games/{GamesScreen,GameDetailsScreen,CreateGameScreen}.tsx`, `gameDisplay.ts`; games endpoints in `shared/lib/api.ts` |
| Player Tournament tab (browse + register) | `features/tournaments/v2/TournamentsScreenV2.tsx` (browse — **role-aware tabs**: Open · Managing/Joined · Results, see below), `v2/TournamentDetailScreen.tsx` (detail + register/withdraw + Chat entry), `v2/TournamentChatScreen.tsx` (participant group chat), `tournamentDisplay.ts`; tournament client (`listPublicTournaments`/`register`/`withdraw`/`getMyTournamentRegistration`/`listMyTournamentRegistrations`/`listTournamentMessages`/`sendTournamentMessage`) in `shared/lib/api.ts`; mounted as the `tournaments` tab + `tournament` detail + `tournament-chat` in `App.tsx` / `shared/lib/navigation.ts`. **Role-gated** by `canSeeTournaments = !isOwner && !isAdmin` in `App.tsx` — players/coaches/organizers see the tab (join/leave only); owners/admins don't (dropped from `V2TabBar`/`TabBar`/`Sidebar`). Organizer tournament CRUD stays in `features/organizer/tournaments/`. |
| Create a game (venue-first + pay) | `features/games/CreateGameScreen.tsx` — `CreateGameWizard`: court → date/start-end → details → `createBooking`+`checkout`+`createGame`; gated by `player.games.create` (+ `player.bookings.create`) |
| Manage games you created (edit details, kick, delete) | `features/games/MyGamesScreen.tsx` (from Profile → "My games") **and** inline on the Games tab's "My Games" rows (`GameManageActions.tsx`); editing reuses `CreateGameScreen` with a `gameId` prop (the `ManageGameScreen` form: edit details + remove players via `kickPlayer`); `updateGame`/`deleteGame`/`kickPlayer` in `shared/lib/api.ts`; gated by `player.games.manage` |
| Payment history / spend report (player) | `features/profile/PaymentHistoryScreen.tsx` (entry rows in `ProfileScreen.tsx` + `v2/ProfileScreenV2.tsx`); `listPayments` in `shared/lib/api.ts` → `GET /api/v1/payments` (self-scoped); `shared/components/ui/Chart.tsx` `BarChart`; gated by `player.payments.view` (`SCREEN_PERMISSIONS` in `App.tsx`) |
| Direct messages / chat (realtime) | `features/messages/{ConversationsScreen,ChatScreen}.tsx`; messaging endpoints in `shared/lib/api.ts`; entry from `GameDetailsScreen` "Message organizer" + Profile → Messages; deep-link `/messages/:id` via `navigation.ts`; gated by `user.messages.send`. Realtime via `shared/hooks/useRealtimeStream.ts` + `shared/lib/realtimeBus.ts` (SSE `GET /api/v1/me/stream`) |
| Live message badge (unread) | `shared/lib/messageStore.ts` + `shared/hooks/useMessagePolling.ts` (started in `App.tsx`); badge on `Sidebar.tsx` Messages button (`.side-tab-badge`), `TabBar.tsx` Messages tab (`.tab-unread-badge`), and `V2Chrome.tsx` V2TopNav Messages icon (`.v2c-notif-badge`) |
| Request-to-book approval deadlines (player + owner countdowns) | Formatters in `features/bookings/bookingDisplay.ts`, ticking via `shared/hooks/useCountdown.ts`. Player: `CourtPicker` "Needs approval" chip, the review-step block + completion copy in `BookCourtScreen.tsx`, the live countdown in `MyBookingsScreen.tsx`. Owner: the chip in `features/owner/components/OwnerBookingRow.tsx` (reaches all four inbox surfaces), deadline-ascending sort in `hooks/useOwnerDashboard.ts`, window settings in `tabs/ListingEditorTab.tsx`. Server-side truth: `api/src/features/bookings/bookingDeadlines.ts` |
| Realtime stream (chat + notifications) | `shared/hooks/useRealtimeStream.ts` (one EventSource, mounted in `App.tsx`) + `shared/lib/realtimeBus.ts` (in-app pub/sub); backed by API `GET /api/v1/me/stream` |
| Live notification badge (unread) | `shared/lib/notificationStore.ts` + `shared/hooks/useNotificationPolling.ts` (started in `App.tsx`); `shared/components/ui/NotificationBadge.tsx` on the home bell + TabBar "You" tab |
| Global search (courts/games/clubs/players) | `features/search/SearchScreen.tsx`; `crossSearch` in `shared/lib/api.ts` → `GET /api/v1/search?type=all`; gated by `player.search.use` |
| Permissions / role gating | `shared/lib/permissions.ts`, `SCREEN_PERMISSIONS` in `App.tsx` |
| Coach subscription / Find Coach / book a coach / coach rates | `features/coaches/` (entry: Profile tab → "Coaching"; the Home `.coach-cta` only links there). ⚠️ Gate the subscribe CTAs on **`user.coachSubscriptionActive`**, never on `roles.includes('coach')` — a venue owner approving a coach application grants that role with **no** subscription, and the role survives a lapsed one. ⚠️ Subscribing does **not** create a `Coach` profile — only a venue owner approving an application does, so a subscriber with no approval has no listing and no rates screen. Rates (standard + per-venue) live in `CoachPricingScreen` → `updateMyCoach`. Backed by `api/src/features/partner-subscriptions/` + `coach-bookings/` |
| Another player's public profile | `features/profile/PlayerProfileScreen.tsx` (`player-profile`, `/players/:id`); `getPublicUser` in `shared/lib/api.ts` → `GET /api/v1/users/:id`; badges via `shared/lib/roleDisplay.ts` |
| Venue-owner console (manage venues) | `features/owner/` (entry row in `ProfileScreen.tsx`); owner endpoints in `shared/lib/api.ts` |
| Owner subscription plans (membership tiers) | `features/owner/SubscriptionPlansScreen.tsx` (`owner-subscription-plans`, from Members tab "Manage Subscription"), `features/owner/components/CreateEditPlanSheet.tsx` (create/edit form), `shared/lib/api.ts` → `listSubscriptionPlans`/`createSubscriptionPlan`/`updateSubscriptionPlan`(versioning)/`deleteSubscriptionPlan`/`duplicateSubscriptionPlan`/`toggleSubscriptionPlan`/`listPublicPlans`/`subscribeToPlan`; player-side: `MembershipSheet.tsx` uses `listPublicPlans` when the owner has active plans (falls back to hardcoded defaults); backed by `SubscriptionPlan`/`SubscriptionPlanVersion`/`VenueSubscription` models in `api/src/features/venues/` |
| Demand data capture (searches, views, bookings funnel, empty slots) | `shared/hooks/useDemandTracking.ts` (client-side signals); `shared/lib/api.ts` → `recordDemandEvent` / `getVenueDemand` / `getVenueLeakageReport` / `getSuggestedPricing`; owner Demand/Leakage/Insights tabs; backed by `api/src/features/demand/` |
| Front desk — manual/walk-in booking + slot blocking + today's schedule | `features/owner/OwnerFrontDeskScreen.tsx` (`owner-front-desk`, from OwnerHome quick action); `createVenueBooking` in `shared/lib/api.ts` → `POST /venues/:id/bookings` |
| Manual reservation (dedicated screen; paints the pricing grid) | `features/owner/OwnerManualReservationScreen.tsx` (`owner-manual-reservation`; desktop 2-col: form + venue's upcoming reservations list). Save = `createVenueBooking({ bookingType: 'manual' })` **and** `createSlotOverride({ price: 0, note: 'Reserved' })` so the hours show green on `OwnerPricingScreen`. Entry: Sidebar item on desktop (≥1024px), owner Profile → Manage row on mobile/tablet (`.mtonly` in `v2.css`). Gated by `owner.bookings.manage` |
| Checkout payment options (deposit/full/pay-at-venue) + 7% service fee | `features/bookings/BookCourtScreen.tsx` (review + checkout steps); owner config in `tabs/ListingEditorTab.tsx`; fee % from `getSettings` |

| Admin reported-post review (resolve/dismiss) | `features/admin/AdminPostReportsScreen.tsx` (`admin-post-reports`, gated by `admin.moderation.manage`); entry "Post reports" row in `OwnerProfileScreen.tsx` / "Admin" section in `v2/ProfileScreenV2.tsx`; `listAdminFeedReports`/`resolveAdminFeedReport` in `shared/lib/api.ts` → `GET|PATCH /api/v1/admin/feed-reports` |
| Organizer console (tournaments, brackets, open play, rosters, venue requests) | `features/organizer/` (entry "Organize" row in `ProfileScreen.tsx`/`ProfileScreenV2.tsx` → `organizer-hub`); organizer endpoints in `shared/lib/api.ts`; gated by `organizer.*` perms (`SCREEN_PERMISSIONS` in `App.tsx`). Reuses the web `/organizer` API — no API/route changes |
| Social tab (PickleFeed + Clubs + Friends, the request badge) | `features/social/{SocialScreen,FeedPanel,FeedPostCard,FeedComposerSheet,FeedShareCard,FeedMedia,feedAttachments,FeedPostScreen,RepostQuote,feedTime,ClubsPanel,FriendsPanel}.tsx`; Feed API client in `shared/lib/api.ts` (`FEED_PREFIX`, `uploadFeedMedia`); post photos (per-photo caption) + comment photos/GIFs via `FeedMedia`/`feedAttachments` (GIFs added by pasting from the keyboard/clipboard into the comment field — `onCommentPaste` — or uploading a .gif); per-post ⋯ menu (interested/not-interested/report/hide/notify) via `setFeedSignal`/`hideFeedPost`/`reportFeedPost`/`subscribeFeedPost`; badge = `shared/lib/friendRequestStore.ts` + `shared/hooks/useFriendRequestPolling.ts`, rendered by `V2TabBar` in `shared/components/layout/V2Chrome.tsx`; styles under `.pb-v2.v2-social` in `shared/styles/v2.css`; e2e in `../api/e2e/feed.sh` |
